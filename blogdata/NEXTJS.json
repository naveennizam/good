    "description": "Next. js is a front-end framework that makes it easy to build fast websites with React—which is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.Being one of the most popular front-end frameworks, React has become a developer favorite. Standard use cases for React are modern stack websites and single-page applications (SPAs). The former spans multiple pages, like a traditional website, but is implemented with a modern framework—while the latter provides an app-like user experience by updating the current page, rather than loading new pages from a server.",
