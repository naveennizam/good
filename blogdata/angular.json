    "description" : "The list of best front end development frameworks is incomplete without mentioning Angular. It is a simple and straightforward UI framework that is based on TypeScript.Formally released in 2016, the Angular framework was established by Google to link the gap between the mounting demands of technology and conventional notions that displayed the results.In contrast to React, Angular is exclusive with its two-way data binding trait. It means that there is actual time synchronization between view and model, where any alteration in the model replicates promptly on view and vice versa."
